# GAN-image-generation-using-UTKFace-dataset

GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are commonly used for generating new images that resemble a given dataset. GANs consist of two networks: a generator that creates new images and a discriminator that evaluates whether an image is real or fake. The goal of the generator is to create images that can fool the discriminator into thinking they are real. It Can generate new data that is similar to the training data, can generate high-quality images, can learn from unlabelled data.
Can be difficult to train, can suffer from mode collapse, can generate unrealistic or low-quality images.

## Problem Statement
The problem addressed in this project is generating realistic images of human faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on the UTKFace dataset. The aim is to develop a model that can effectively generate high-quality images of human faces with diverse features, such as age, gender, and ethnicity. This problem statement addresses the challenge of creating a GAN model that can produce images that are not only visually appealing but also highly realistic and diverse.
